Code for ["Adventure: Adversarial Training for Textual Entailment with Knowledge-Guided Examples"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04680.pdf) by Dongyeop Kang, Tushar Khot, Ashish Sabharwal and Eduard Hovy, ACL 2018

## NOTE:
 - For s2s training, you need pre-trained entailment classifier. In this work, we used Decomposable Attention model.
 - Maintenance of this repository might be little slow.
 - More code refactoring and detailed documentation will be made soon.
